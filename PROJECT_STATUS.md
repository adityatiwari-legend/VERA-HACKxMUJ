## 1. Executive Summary

**VERA** is a production-grade, end-to-end transparent donation and fund-tracking platform. It eliminates the traditional charitable "black box" by chaining cryptographic evidence, AI/OCR discrepancy auditing, multi-party signature authorization, and smart contract fund releases into an auditable public trail.

### The Complete Working Pipeline:
```text
DONOR
  ↓
DONATION (Native Testnet Cryptocurrency / Simulated Contribution)
  ↓
EARMARKED CAMPAIGN (Bound strictly to initiative; no silent reassignments)
  ↓
LOCKED ESCROW (Atomic PostgreSQL transaction + Smart Contract Custody)
  ↓
MILESTONE ALLOCATION (Work segmented into deliverables with budget caps)
  ↓
PROOF SUBMITTED (Invoices, payment receipts, site execution photos)
  ↓
AI VERIFICATION (OCR line-item extraction flags mathematical discrepancies)
  ↓
HUMAN AUDITOR (Certified auditor reviews AI findings & authorizes evidence)
  ↓
2-OF-3 MULTISIG APPROVAL (NGO Admin + Project Lead + Auditor consensus)
  ↓
BLOCKCHAIN RELEASE (Smart contract executes non-reentrant release)
  ↓
BENEFICIARY SPEND EVIDENCE (Protected vendor invoice records)
  ↓
PUBLIC AUDIT TRAIL (Unauthenticated public dashboard with block explorer links)
```

## 7. Deterministic NGO Reputation Formula

Implemented in [`lib/reputation.ts`](file:///d:/HackXxMUJ/lib/reputation.ts) without black-box AI ranking:

$$\text{Base Score} = 100$$
$$\text{Deductions} = -15 \times \text{Failed Milestones} - 10 \times \text{Rejected Proofs} - 5 \times \text{AI Discrepancy Flags} - 10 \times \text{Refunds}$$
$$\text{Bonuses} = \min(30, 10 \times \text{Completed Milestones}) + (5 \text{ if 100\% proof approval}) + (5 \text{ if } \ge 70\% \text{ utilization with 0 flags})$$
$$\text{Final Score} = \max(0, \min(100, \text{Calculated Score}))$$

- **Tiers:** A+ (95–100), A (85–94), B (70–84), C (55–69), D (0–54).

## 8. Security & System Invariants

1. **Zero Private Key Leakage:** `BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY` is strictly confined to server-side code. Never stored in PostgreSQL, never serialized to frontend bundles.
2. **Atomic Financial Invariants:**
   - `raised_amount >= locked_amount`
   - `raised_amount >= released_amount`
   - `released_amount <= raised_amount`
   - `locked_amount = raised_amount - released_amount - refunded_amount`
   - Zero negative balances.
3. **Double-Release & Double-Refund Protection:** Enforced both in PostgreSQL state transitions and smart contract require statements.
4. **Strict 2-of-3 Multi-Signature Consensus:** No single actor (neither NGO nor Admin) can release funds unilaterally. Requires independent signatures from authorized roles.
5. **Storage Sanitization:** Evidence files are sanitized against path traversal, validated against strict MIME whitelists (`PDF`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, `WEBP`), and fingerprinted with SHA-256 hashes.

---

## 9. Important Limitations & Disclosures

1. **Testnet Cryptocurrency:** Blockchain operations execute on Ethereum testnets (Sepolia / Holesky / Hardhat). Testnet ether possesses zero real-world monetary value and functions exclusively as an immutable state ledger.
2. **Offline Reality Boundaries:** VERA guarantees that funds cannot move without recorded evidence and multi-signature authorization. It does not claim blockchain provides offline omniscience: human auditor inspection remains necessary for physical worksmanship verification.
3. **Escrow Allocation vs Currency Tracking:** In pooled community initiatives, fund journeys reflect programmatic accounting allocation within the campaign escrow rather than tracking individual physical currency notes.
